        <h1>Hello, I'm Samuel A. Atilano</h1>
        <p  class = "box-p"> I'm a Computer Sciene Major with a Statistics Minor. My Academic focus here at Colby college
            lies in Artificial Intelligence. I am passionate about Neural Networks and their ability to learn and adapt. 
            <br><br>
            Beyond my studies, I'm deeply interested in Game Design as a core hobby. I enjoy creating experiences that tell a story, 
            display my creativity, and invoke emotion from the Player. 
            <br><br>
            My goal is to keep exploring AI through the Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Science fields.   
        </p>

        <p  class = "box-p">
            Aside from Computer Science, I like to fill my free time with my hobbies. I find that it's a chance for my
            brain to cool and relax before I begin to study once more. 
        </p>
